# REQUIREMENTS
  
## Introduction
  
This project is an exciting fun game for beginners to build up. The program generates a random number from 1 to 10, or 1 to 100 any range that is specified and the user must guess the number after a hint from the computer. Every time a user’s guess is wrong they are prompted with more hints to make it easier for them to guess the number but at the cost of reducing the score. 
The program also requires functions to check if an actual number is entered by the user or not, to compare the input number with the actual number, to find the difference between the two numbers.

## What
It is a game in which user needs to guess a number within a given range when the user fails, a clue will be given and score will be reduced untill user guess the number.The user has an option to set the range i.e., lower bound and upper bound.The user can update the settings according to his needs.
## When
 This games are also played in parties and also in schools to test their skills.This game can be played both for fun and also to improve mathematical skills. And also
 this game is usually played by everyone who loves trail and error and also needs to build up their analytical skills
## Who
This game are played by children, youth and also adults irrespective of their ages in their free time.The person who are interested in games and also want to increase there reasoning skills plays this game usually.
## Where
This game can be played both online and offline but here we designed this game online even a single person can play this game without a second person.If a person needs to play offline then he needs second person who gives clues but here the system generates the clues so it will be best for people who are alone
## How
The user needs to enter a number by guess, if it is wrong then the system gives a the user must find with the clue untill the correct guess the system generates clues and score will be reduced for every clue

## About the GUESSING_GAME GAME
  •The number guessing game is all about guessing a number which was generated from random module.
  
  •Here the user need to enter his/her name before starting the game, after that the user need to select any one of the options i.e., play game, reset settings, get persnol        best or exit.

  •If the user wish to change the settings, he/she needs to enter the lower and upper bound and play the game.
## Advantages
   • It's fast and accurate.
  
   • Improves the coding and analytical skills.
   
   • Also improves our logical thinking.
## Disadvantages
  • If the range is large(the difference between the lower and upper bound) guessin a number is a time consuming process.
